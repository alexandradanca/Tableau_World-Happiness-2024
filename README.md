<h3>📌 Objectives</h3>
<p>Using Tableau, a dashboard was created to visualize: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Happiness Score by Country:</b> Highlighting the happiness levels across nations.</li>
  <li><b>Happiness Factors by Country:</b> Displaying averages for key contributors such as Generosity, Healthy Life Expectancy, Perceptions of Corruption, and Social Support.</li>
</ul>
<p>This dashboard helps identify trends, regional differences, and the impact of various factors on happiness.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><b>Afghanistan</b> has the lowest happiness score of <b>1.721</b>, followed by <b>Lebanon with 2.707</b>. A key reason for these low scores is the significantly lower average values for factors such as Generosity, Healthy Life Expectancy, Perceptions of Corruption, and Social Support, compared to <b>Finland</b>, the happiest country with a score of <b>7.741</b>.</p>
<p>Notably, <b>Afghanistan's Social Support</b> is recorded as <b>0</b>, indicating a complete lack of support systems, which is a critical contributor to its low happiness level. This stark contrast with Finland, where all these factors have much higher averages, underscores the essential role of social infrastructure and trust in fostering happiness.</p>
